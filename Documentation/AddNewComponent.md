# To add your own webpage to the UI:

1- Update the nav bar by appending to the navLinks list in App.js, giving your new page an appropriate title and a route. 

2- Create you new react component and import it into /Components/Playback/Playback.js.
   Add route to render(), using the same route chosen in step 1 as your
   exact path.
