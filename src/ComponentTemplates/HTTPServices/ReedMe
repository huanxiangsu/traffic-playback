The playback app falls under the umbrella of Client <-> Server apps.
This folder has two types of classes.
One type is the HTTPClientEndPoint class.This class is used by the client.
The client is our actual app. The server is the back end server.
The purpose of the HTTPClientEndPoint class is to accept responses from the server and forward them 
the client, the app.
The purpose of the HTTPServiceXXXXX classes, where XXXXX can be a button, or some 
other type of control is to communicate to the backend service via HTTP or HTTPS.
TCP support can also be built in at a later time.
When the HTTPServiceXXXXX sends a message to a url, the server processes the communication, talks to the DB, and will send a response.
At which point, the HTTPServiceXXXX component will pass the result to the HTTPClientEndPoint class.
The HTTPClientEndPoint class will then pass off the results to the PlayBack component.
Note: The exact implementation details of the HTTP service class are not know at 
the time of this writing, but they will be known when back end server development begins.
